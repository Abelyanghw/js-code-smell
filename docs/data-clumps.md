## Data clumps

Sometimes different parts of the code contain identical groups of variables (such as parameters for connecting to a database). These clumps should be turned into their own classes.


solution: 

If repeating data comprises the fields of a class, use Extract Class to move the fields to their own class.
If the same data clumps are passed in the parameters of methods, use Introduce Parameter Object to set them off as a class.
If some of the data is passed to other methods, think about passing the entire data object to the method instead of just individual fields. Preserve Whole Object will help with this.
Look at the code used by these fields. It may be a good idea to move this code to a data class.
