##Primitive Obsession

### Signs and Symptoms

- Use of primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks (such as currency, ranges, special strings for phone numbers, etc.)
- Use of constants for coding information (such as a constant USER_ADMIN_ROLE = 1 for referring to users with administrator rights.)
- Use of string constants as field names for use in data arrays.


Solution :  
  1. replace data value with object
  2. introduce parameter object or preserve whole object
  3. replace code with subclass, replace type code with state/strategy.
  4. replace array with object.
